Simple plugin that walks your current working directories, finds all files marked as executable and let you run them inside Sublime Text.

Gives you five basic commands:

- Executor: Execute
- Executor: Execute with Args
- Executor: Repeat Recent
- Executor: Repeat Last
- Executor: Cancel

Uses `output.exec` panel to stream both stdout and stderr.

Knows about `.gitignore` enough to skip looking into ignored paths.

## Known limitations

- Probably doesnâ€™t work on Windows
- `!` in `.gitignore` is not supported
- Global `.gitignore` is not supported
- Sublime Text excludes are not supported
- On large projects listing might take long time
